The @app.route decorator in Flask is used to bind a function to a URL. 
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the two routes in your code:

@app.route('/')
    URL: /
    HTTP Method: GET (default)
    Function: index()
    Purpose: This route serves the main page of your web application. 
        When a user navigates to the root URL of your application, the index() 
        function is called, which renders the index.html template.

@app.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
    URL: /chat
    HTTP Method: POST
    Function: run(self)
    Purpose: This route handles POST requests sent to the /chat URL. 
        It is typically used to handle form submissions or AJAX requests where 
        data is sent to the server. In this case, the run(self) function is 
        called, which appears to handle the chatbot logic by getting the model 
        and tokenizer and then calling the chat method.

Summary
    @app.route('/'): Used to serve the main page of the application.
    @app.route('/chat', methods=['POST']): Used to handle chat interactions, 
        processing user input and generating responses.
